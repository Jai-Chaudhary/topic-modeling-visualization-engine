As with any project, TMVE can still be improved.  Here's a list of some things that are being considered or are in the works.  Feel free to email ajb.chaney@gmail.com if you have any suggestions.

 - expand templates
 - rewrite rendering of pages to be generated dynamically, possibly using Ruby on Rails
 - allow for comments at the end of lines in project and template files

Additionally, a list of in-line TODO comments can be found by running the following command in this directory:

    grep -r TODO *

Or, if you downloaded from a repository:

    grep -r  --exclude='*\.svn*' TODO *
